# Blue-Team-Encryption

<STRONG>OVERVIEW:</STRONG>	<br/>
Encryption is a crucial part of the digital age in the 21st century due to the amount of Personally Identifiable Information that is being transmitted over the Internet. Encryption is the process of encoding data or information that only allows the intended recipient the capability of decoding and reading the message. There are two types of encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric. The most widely used type is Asymmetric because it is more secure due to the two-key system. This two key system uses public keys to encrypt the data and then private keys to decrypt the data.
	To fully understand how encryption works, one must learn how the current algorithms work and read on what kind of algorithms are being created.

<STRONG>Objective:</STRONG> <br/>
  •	Understand how current methods of encryption work <br/>
  •	Build encryption algorithms <br/>
  •	Have this algorithm withstand encryption crackers <br/>
  •	Can decrypt the data when needed

<STRONG>Goals:</STRONG> <br/>
  •	Research both Asymmetric and Symmetric Algorithms <br/>
  •	Research new algorithms that are being created <br/>
  •	Create a working algorithm that will encrypt and decrypt data <br/>
  •	Demonstrate how this algorithm can withstand well-known password crackers <br/>

<STRONG>Scope (Steps):</STRONG>
  1.	Understand the current encryption algorithms and how they work <br/>
    a.	These algorithms include but aren’t limited to: SHA-256, Blowfish, Two-Fish, AES, DES, RSA, and DSA <br/>
  2.	Research other publications within this field of study to understand how others are taking on a task like this <br/>
