# Blue-Team-Encryption

<STRONG>OVERVIEW:</STRONG>	<br/>
Encryption is a crucial part of the digital age in the 21st century due to the amount of Personally Identifiable Information that is being transmitted over the Internet. Encryption is the process of encoding data or information that only allows the intended recipient the capability of decoding and reading the message. There are two types of encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric. The most widely used type is Asymmetric because it is more secure due to the two-key system. This two key system uses public keys to encrypt the data and then private keys to decrypt the data. 
	To fully understand how encryption works, one must learn how the current algorithms work and read on what kind of algorithms are being created.

<STRONG>Objective:</STRONG> <br/>
  •	Understand how current methods of encryption work <br/>
  •	Build an encryption algorithm with the coding language Python that can ensure data security <br/>
  •	Have this algorithm withstand encryption crackers <br/>
  •	Can decrypt the data when needed

<STRONG>Goals:</STRONG> <br/>
  •	Research both Asymmetric and Symmetric Algorithms <br/>
  •	Research new algorithms that are being created <br/>
  •	Create a working algorithm that will encrypt and decrypt data <br/>
  •	Demonstrate how this algorithm can withstand well-known password crackers <br/>
  •	Explain and summarize results in a 10-12-page written report

<STRONG>Proposal</STRONG> <br/>
	The “Blue Team” proposes to build an encryption algorithm using the Python language that can ensure data security. Through this project the “Blue Team” hopes to get a deeper understanding of how modern-day encryption works in order to expand our knowledge of encryption.

<STRONG>Strategy</STRONG> <br/>
	In order to complete this project our strategy is to research existing algorithms, newly created algorithms, and how they work. To do this research there will be online articles (found through web searches), journals, videos, and written books.
  
<STRONG>Timeline</STRONG> <br/>
Key Deliverables: <br/>
    •	A secure encryption algorithm that is written in Python <br/>
    •	Project Demo  <br/>
      o	Possibly a video that demonstrates a file that is encrypted with our algorithm being attempted to be broken by encryption crackers <br/>
    •	10-12-page written report that will explain and summarize results and findings <br/>
Scope (Steps): <br/>
  1.	Understand the current encryption algorithms and how they work <br/>
    a.	These algorithms include but aren’t limited to: SHA-256, Blowfish, Two-Fish, AES, DES, RSA, and DSA <br/>
  2.	Research other publications within this field of study to understand how others are taking on a task like this <br/>
  3.	Create an encryption with pseudocode <br/>
  4.	Finalize algorithm and complete the code <br/>
  5.	Conduct tests <br/>
  6.	Write a report summarizing project
