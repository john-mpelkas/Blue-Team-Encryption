<h1>Caesar Cipher</h1>
  <p> Caesar cipher is one of the most well known and simple encryption techniques.
The Caesar cipher is known as a substitution cipher, meaning, each letter in
plan text is replaced by a fixed number of positions down the used alphabet. </p>
<br/>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p> In this example we are going to be replacing letters by a fixed position of
one. <p>

`The dog jumps over the wall.`
<br/>
`Uif eph kvnqt pwfs uif xbmm.`
